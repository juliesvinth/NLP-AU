# Classroom instructions

The files in this folder provide an overview of what we will be covering in classrooms on a weekly basis.

In most cases, the files here will also include specific information about in-class assignments that you'll be working on.

Make sure to ```git pull``` regularly to your fork, so that you're up-to-date!
