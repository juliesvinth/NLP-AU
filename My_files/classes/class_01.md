# Class 1: The work stack

This class will take us through the work stack we will be using for Natural Language Processing.

Some of this will be things that are only relevant for this course, such as using Github Classroom and integrating UCloud with Github. Other things will be useful more generally, such as using Github for collaboration and project management.

We'll also look a little bit at some more aspects of Python scripting. Taken together, everything we cover today will have you well on your way to writing some kickass code!

## Plan for today

### UCloud

- Integrating UCloud with Github
- Adding Github token and set-up script

### Github

- Forking the main repo
- Github Classrooms

### Python scripting

- Virtual environments
- Requirements files
- Adding command line arguments

## Assignments

- Two assignments via Github Classroom
  - One is an optional tour of Github
